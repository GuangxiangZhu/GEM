GEM (**G**enomic organization reconstructor based on conformational **E**nergy and **M**anifold learning) is a manifold learning framework for reconstructing spatial organizations of chromosomes.

## CITATION
Guangxiang Zhu, Wenxuan Deng, Hailin Hu, Rui Ma, Sai Zhang, Tommy Kaplan, Jian Peng, and Jianyang Zeng*. ``A manifold learning based framework for reconstructing spatial organizations of chromosomes'', *Under review*, 2017.


## INSTALLATION
Put all the MATLAB script files in your MATLAB path. 

## USAGE
Directly run the m-file **GEM.m** with parameters in the directory. 

* Example

    do the following at the MATLAB command line:  

    ```GEM(5E12,4,1E4,0)```

* Parameters

    First： Energy coefficient. Default is 5E12.

    Second： Number of conformations. Default is 4.

    Third： maximum number of iterations. Default is 1E4.

    Four： Whether to perform parameter selection (1-yes, 0-no). Default is 0.
